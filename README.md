# PHP Variable Scope Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to variable scope within functions and loops. The bug arises when a function unintentionally relies on variables outside its local scope, leading to unexpected behavior and making debugging difficult. The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` presents the corrected version.
